##VGA Driver
Using VHDL to drive a test screen to using an HDMI to VGA cable

#Implementation
- This lab used D flip flops for states (current and next) as well as for the buffers.
- H_sync diagram
- V_sync diagram

# `vga_sync`
This connects v_sync and h_sync
# `v_sync_gen`
# `h_sync_gen`
This generates the horizontal signals
# `v_sync`
This generates the vertical signals
# `pixel_gen`
This assigns RGB to different values to display different colors
